It provides access to train images and handles image loading through\n* the ImageManager. This class implements the RenderersRoot interface and offers basic support for\n* retrieving train-related images, though several renderer methods remain unimplemented as stubs.\n*\n* @author [Author Name]\n* @see RenderersRoot\n* @see ImageManager\n* @see TrainImages\n*/"
